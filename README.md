## Notice

This is still WIP and not production ready. However all the code in the Caliburn.Noesis and Caliburn.Noesis/Extension folders should be good to go, especially the various Screen and Conductor base classes and interfaces.
Once this is ready for production use there will be a proper release and documentation.
Until then any suggestions, comments and contributions are welcome though.
